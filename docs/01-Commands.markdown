Commands
========

## What are commands?

Commands are slightly like an installation wizard. Yeah, I know
it's a slightly shitty thing to say, but think about this for
a second. How many times do you setup an apache vhost or update
your hosts file for new projects that come down the pipe line?

Commands allow you to edit your hosts file and setup your apache
vhost quickly so you can get the project up and running quickly.
