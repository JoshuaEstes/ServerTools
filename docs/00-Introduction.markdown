Introduction to ServerTools
===========================

## What are ServerTools?

ServerTools is a collection of cli commands that allow you to
quickly do things that you do often. One of the goals of this
project is to allow you to easily add your own commands so
that you can use this within your daily work flow.

## What ServerTools are not!

They are really server tools, but more of a developer tool toolset.
This project is not meant to include commands for every single
task you could ever want. It also isn't for things such as provisioning
a server. This is meant to be ran on you local development box.

## Vision

Where this project is headed will be mostly up to the community.
One of the factors that I feel will make this successful is to
allow other developers to easily add and their own tasks.

I believe that this is the core of the project and that other
bundles will be included for specific developer workflows.

In the future I want to include things such as project setup
for things such as Silex and Symfony2. I'm freaking lazy and
hate setting them all constantly.

## Contributing

Fork the damn project already, or clone it and start adding your own
commands.
